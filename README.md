DriverPass Portfolio Reflection

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is an online-web application that offering online and on-the-road driver training for student drivers. The client, DriverPass, Liam (the Owner) needed a system that would allow students to create accounts, schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, make secure payments, and track their learning progress. Additionally, the system needed to manage different staff roles, track changes to reservations, and maintain updated DMV compliance. DriverPass wanted a flexible, cloud-based platform that could grow with their business and provide a simple user experience for students, instructors, secretaries, IT staff, and DMV partners.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a job of capturing the client’s core needs through detailed diagrams and documentation. I made sure that every type of user — students, instructors, IT staff, DMV staff — had their actions clearly represented. I design and created simples diagrams and system requirement analysist for the DriverPass system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I would spend more time refining the class diagram by adding methods and interactions between classes, such as how a reservation links directly to a car and driver. This would make the system’s internal structure even more clear for developers who would eventually build it. I would also make sure to capture all the system’s flexibility needs more explicitly, like enabling or disabling training packages.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I reviewed the client’s vision and paid attention to both the functional and nonfunctional details they shared. I designed the system to make the student experience as smooth as possible while making administrative tasks easier for the business staff. Considering the user’s needs is critical because it ensures the system will actually solve the problems the client has, make work easier for their team, and create a better experience for customers.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I start by deeply understanding the client’s goals and the users’ everyday tasks. Then, I use techniques like interviews, requirement gathering, user stories, and visual models such as UML diagrams to organize the information. In the future, I will continue using these methods, but I will also try to involve user feedback earlier during the design stage. This way, I can catch any missing needs or problems early and adjust the design before it gets too far into development.
